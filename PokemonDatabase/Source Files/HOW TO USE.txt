CSVDatabaseReader

It's a very simple program.
Open the project in Visual Studio and Start the code. The Console will wait for an input from your PC.
Here you'll fill in the path to the Veekun Database. (If that doesn't work, change "string SourcePath = Console.ReadLine()" to @"INSERT PATH HERE".
Then it'll loop through the CSV files and it'll create an OUTPUT.txt in the same path as the source path.
In this OUTPUT.txt will be all the Pokemon writting according to the Pokemon.cs class from Pokemon Unity.
