CSVDatabaseReader

It's a pretty simple program, the guide is on screen when you start it.
You have to fill in a valid path to the Veekun Database (this should be in a directory on your PC).
In that directory should be ALL the .csv files from Veekun, since my program depends on those files.
Then you can pick your GEN that you want to convert to Pokemon Unity's PokemonData format.
This will take some time and has a pretty big impact on your CPU (Will fix in the future).
When it's done you can find the Output.txt in the same folder as the .csv files.
You can copy and paste those into the PokemonDatabase.cs in Pokemon Unity.
The only thing that you need to change is the PokemonData class, where you should replace the egg group to the Veekun type's.

public enum EggGroup
{
  MONSTER,
  WATER1,
  BUG,
  FLYING,
  GROUND,
  FAIRY,
  PLANT,
  HUMANSHAPE,
  WATER3,
  MINERAL,
  INDETERMINATE,
  WATER2,
  DITTO,
  DRAGON,
  UNDISCOVERED,
  NONE
};

Simple right?
