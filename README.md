In this GitHub repo you'll find some helpful tools, programs and files to help you build your Pokemon game with Pokemon Unity.

In the Database folder you'll find the Veekun database and a converter which can convert the Veekun database into a database suitable for Pokemon Unity
In the Sprites folder you can find sprites (in GIF, Spritesheet and frame format) from Pokemon Black 2 and White 2 + a program that supports GIF to spritesheet and GIF to frames
In the Unity Scripts folder you can find some helpful scripts that can help you with Pokemon Unity, like Ashy's SpriteSizeChanger (which changes the size of the sprite in Unity depending on the dimensions of the frames)

I hope you can find something interesting or helpful in this repo.
If you have any questions you can ask them in the Pokemon Unity Discord server (in which I'm active)
