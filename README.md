The sprite GIF animations are downloaded from: https://sprites.pokecheck.org/
The 'GIF to SH' program is an edited version of: https://forum.chaos-project.com/index.php?topic=11601.0

This GitHub Repository includes some helpful programs and items for PK-Unity, like a Veekun Database to PK-Unity Database converter and a GIF to Spritesheet converter.
Really helpful stuff.
These stuff are made for Pokemon Unity because I have too much spare time.
